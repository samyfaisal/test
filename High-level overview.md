# VoIP Call Manager Project Overview

The Zenda system is a comprehensive VoIP Call Manager and Contact Center solution that integrates telephony services, CRM capabilities, and business workflow management. Built on modern .NET technology, it provides a scalable, feature-rich platform for managing customer interactions across multiple channels.

## Modules Description

### Zenda.Engine

- **Purpose**: Core processing engine that manages call flows, telephony events, and business logic.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Handling call lifecycle management
  - Managing bridges and connections between channels
  - Orchestrating workflows for different call scenarios
  - Coordinating waiting lists and dialing lists
  - Scheduling tasks and actions
- **Interactions**: Interfaces with Asterisk through ARI, communicates with database layer, and provides services to client applications.

### Zenda.ARI

- **Purpose**: Asterisk REST Interface adapter that provides communication with the underlying Asterisk PBX.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Managing WebSocket connections to Asterisk
  - Handling Stasis events and actions
  - Providing channel management capabilities
  - Processing media operations (playback, recording)
- **Interactions**: Connects directly to Asterisk and exposes telephony functionality to the Engine module.

### Zenda.DAL and Zenda.DAL.Common

- **Purpose**: Data Access Layer that provides database operations and entity management.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Entity mapping and persistence
  - Database query operations
  - Transaction management
  - Entity relationships
- **Interactions**: Used by all other modules that require data persistence or retrieval.

### Zenda.WebKit

- **Purpose**: Web-based user interfaces for administrators, agents, and system management.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Admin portal for system configuration
  - Agent workspace for call handling
  - Reporting and analytics dashboards
  - User management interfaces
- **Interactions**: Communicates with the Engine through API endpoints and receives real-time updates.

### Zenda.CrmIntegration

- **Purpose**: Integration layer for connecting with external CRM systems.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Customer data lookup and synchronization
  - Call event notifications to CRM systems
  - URL generation for customer records
  - Customer creation and update operations
- **Interactions**: Connects with external CRM systems and provides customer data to the Engine and WebKit.

### Zenda.Service

- **Purpose**: Windows/Linux service that hosts the Engine and provides system-level integration.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Service lifecycle management
  - System integration with OS
  - Process monitoring and recovery
- **Interactions**: Hosts the Engine module and integrates with operating system services.

### Zenda.LIC

- **Purpose**: License management and validation system.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - License validation and enforcement
  - Feature access control based on license type
  - Hardware binding for license security
- **Interactions**: Used by the Engine to validate system operation and feature availability.

### Zenda.Softphone

- **Purpose**: Software-based phone client for agent use.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Audio input/output management
  - SIP protocol handling
  - Call control interface
  - Media processing
- **Interactions**: Connects to the system as an endpoint and communicates with the Engine.

### Zenda.Loging

- **Purpose**: Centralized logging system for diagnostics and troubleshooting.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Log collection and storage
  - Log level management
  - Structured logging format
- **Interactions**: Used by all modules to record operational events and errors.

### Zenda.Common

- **Purpose**: Shared utilities and common functionality.
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Helper methods and extensions
  - Common data structures
  - Shared constants and configurations
- **Interactions**: Referenced by all other modules for common functionality.

## Module Interactions

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer** (WebKit, Softphone): Provides user interfaces and interaction points.

2. **Service Layer** (Engine, Service): Implements business logic and orchestrates system operations.

3. **Integration Layer** (ARI, CrmIntegration): Connects with external systems and services.

4. **Data Layer** (DAL, DAL.Common): Manages data persistence and retrieval.

5. **Cross-Cutting Concerns** (LIC, Loging, Common): Provide functionality used across all layers.

Data flows through these layers as follows:

- User actions in the WebKit trigger API calls to the Engine
- The Engine processes these requests, interacting with ARI for telephony operations
- Customer data is retrieved or updated through CrmIntegration
- Persistent data is stored and retrieved via the DAL
- All operations are validated against license restrictions and logged appropriately

## Key Features

1. **Advanced Call Management**:
   - Intelligent call routing
   - Queue management
   - IVR workflows
   - Call recording and monitoring

2. **Agent Workspace**:
   - Real-time call control
   - Customer information display
   - Call classification
   - After-call work management

3. **CRM Integration**:
   - Customer identification
   - Screen pop functionality
   - Call history synchronization
   - Customer data lookup

4. **Outbound Dialing**:
   - Predictive dialing capabilities
   - Campaign management
   - Dialing list administration
   - Call blending

5. **Administration**:
   - System configuration
   - User and extension management
   - Queue and routing setup
   - Reporting and analytics

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on .NET 8.0 with a service-oriented architecture. It utilizes:

- Asterisk PBX for telephony functionality
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- NHibernate for ORM capabilities
- Blazor for web interfaces
- REST APIs for service communication

The modular design allows for scalability and flexibility, with components that can be deployed across multiple servers for larger installations.

## Conclusion

The Zenda VoIP Call Manager is a comprehensive solution that provides enterprise-grade contact center capabilities with flexible integration options. Its modular architecture allows for scalability while maintaining performance and reliability. The system is designed to support both traditional call center operations and modern omnichannel customer engagement strategies.
